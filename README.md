# About project

This is an exercise to read an encoded message from a txt file and return its decoded version.

The text file is of the form:

```
3 love
6 computers
2 dogs
4 cats
1 I
5 you
```

The task was to decode a hidden message based on the arrangement of these numbers in a ``` pyramid structure ```

The pyramid increases by one like so:

```
1
2,3
4,5,6
```

The code to deciphering the message lies at the end of each pyramid. For this file, the program outputs ``` I love computers ```.
